                        Hi! I'm Patrick Borja, the creator of this website. Most people called me by my surname, or by my nickname which <br>

                    <h4>Core Values</h4>             
                    <p>
                        I operate with integrity and honesty, holding myself to high ethical standards in both personal and professional endeavors. <br>
                        I value meaningful connections with others, fostering relationships that bring joy, support, and shared experiences. <br>
                        I cultivate a mindset of gratitude, appreciating the present moment and acknowledging the positive aspects of my life. <br>
                        I seek and align myself with activities, projects, and relationships that resonate with my sense of purpose and contribute to my overall fulfillment. <br>

                        In the tapestry of my life, passion and interest weave the vibrant threads that define my journey. <br>
                        Fueling my enthusiasm for exploration and self-discovery, these twin forces propel me towards <br>
                        meaningful pursuits. Whether immersed in the world of literature, where the written word becomes  <br>
                        a portal to different realms, or engaged in the rhythmic dance of brushstrokes on a canvas, <br>
                        my interests are diverse and dynamic. Passion is the flame that ignites my soul, driving me to  <br>
                        delve into the intricacies of each endeavor with unwavering curiosity. From the subtle nuances of <br>
                        nature photography to the captivating melodies of classical music, I find joy in cultivating a mosaic <br>
                        of interests that enrich my experiences and contribute to the kaleidoscope of my ever-evolving identity. <br>
                        In this journey, passion and interest become not just hobbies but the guiding stars, steering me towards <br>
                        a life infused with purpose and fulfillment.

                        I finished my Elementary Education at Ib***** Ila*** Elementary School in 2009. <br> 
                        (Sadly, I may not have gotten any awards except for being industrious.) <br> <br>
                        I finished my High School Education at *** ***** Parochial School in 2019. <br>
                        The school focuses a lot in performing arts a lot, especially theaters and that kind of thing. <br>
                        I got a few honor roll during my stay there but I still haven't felt I fulfilled anything during the stay. <br>
                        But I got to see my self more, know rather. <br> <br>
                        Finished Senior High at the same school taking General Academic Strand (GAS). <br> <br>

                        In the eyes of those who know me, I am often perceived as a vibrant and expressive individual. <br>
                        My penchant for being loud and my love for singing may give the impression of someone who <br>
                        embraces life with enthusiasm and isn't afraid to let their voice be heard. Despite the occasional <br> 
                        tag of being "annoying," I see it as a reflection of my spirited nature. My passion for creativity <br>
                        shines through in various ways; from playing the guitar to delving into the world of filmmaking, I  <br>
                        find joy in expressing myself through artistic endeavors. While some may view me as boisterous, I <br>
                        believe that my love for music and my creative pursuits add unique hues to the canvas of who I am. <br>

                    <h4>My Current Journey in Taking BSIT Course</h4>
                    <p>
                        Embarking on the journey of pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology has been <br>
                        a transformative experience for me. As I navigate through the realms of this dynamic field, <br>
                        each step unfolds new layers of understanding and skill acquisition. From delving into coding  <br>
                        languages to exploring the intricacies of network systems, my educational voyage has been both <br>
                        challenging and rewarding. Engaging in collaborative projects and immersing myself in hands-on <br>
                        experiences has not only deepened my technical proficiency but has also honed my problem-solving <br>
                        abilities. This journey is not just an academic pursuit but a continuous exploration, where each <br>
                        lesson contributes to the shaping of my knowledge and passion for the ever-evolving landscape of <br>
                        Information Technology. As I progress, I eagerly anticipate further growth and the invaluable <br>
                        insights that this educational endeavor promises to offer.

                        Presently, I find myself facing a set of challenges that hinder my progress and hinder my <br>
                        ability to delve deeper into learning. Distractions pose a persistent obstacle, diverting <br>
                        my focus and impeding my journey forward. Emotional fluctuations further complicate matters, <br>
                        adding a layer of complexity to my endeavors. Sleepless nights, marked by restless contemplation, <br> 
                        contribute to a sense of fatigue and unease, making it difficult to approach tasks with clarity. <br>
                        Moreover, there's a prevailing uncertainty about the path ahead, a sense of not quite knowing <br>
                        where to go or how to navigate the next steps. These challenges, though formidable, serve as <br>
                        points of reflection and opportunities for growth, encouraging me to address each obstacle <br>
                        with resilience and a commitment to overcoming them.

                        and tell stories through the lens of a camera. Photography provides a still <br>
                        yet powerful medium for me to freeze moments in time. Engaging in the art of <br>
                        editing enables me to refine and enhance my visual creations. Singing and <br>
                        music serve as outlets for my self-expression, allowing me to immerse myself <br>
                        in the world of melodies and rhythms. Additionally, drawing adds a tactile <br>
                        and hands-on dimension to my creative pursuits, offering me another avenue <br>
                        to translate my thoughts and emotions into visual form. Each hobby contributes <br>
